    "The world of reality has its limits; the world of imagination is boundless.",
    "It is too difficult to think nobly when one thinks only of earning a living.",
    "Every person has a right to risk their own life for the preservation of it.",
    "Civilization is a hopeless race to discover remedies for the evils it produces.",
    "Every man having been born free and master of himself, no one else may under any pretext whatever subject him without his consent. To assert that the son of a slave is born a slave is to assert that he is not born a man.",
    "The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms strength into right, and obedience into duty.",
    "The general will is always right, but the judgment which guides it is not always enlightened.",
